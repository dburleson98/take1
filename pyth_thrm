#This is a formula for the pythagorean theorem. 
#This formula assumes the user is looking to solve for 'c', but still has the capability of solving for 'a' or 'b'.
#To instead solve for 'a' or 'b', explicitly define your 'c' arguement in addition to the first argument.
#Arguments should be entered as their side lengths only, no squaring necessary.
