# This is a function written in R Studio for solving binomial probabilities.
# Based on 3 given arguments, the function will return all 3 of the following:
# (1) Probability of less than or equal to the given number of successes.   |
# (2) Probability of greater than the given number of successes.            |  all out of a given number of 'n' trials.
# (3) Probability of exactly the given number of successes.                 |

whatodds_binom <- function(prob_of_success, num_of_success, total_trials){
  p <- prob_of_success
  # 'p' argument specifies the probability of success for any given trial.
  f <- 1 - prob_of_success
  x <- num_of_success
  # 'x' argument specifies how many successes you're shooting for.
  n <- total_trials
  # 'n' argument specifies how many total trials the function consists of. 
  counter <- 0
  # 'counter' variable will help compute greater than and less than probabilities.
  total_dist <- 0
  # 'total_dist' variable will be used for the same purpose as 'counter'.
