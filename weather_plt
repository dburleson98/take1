'''
The program takes 2 lists as inputs: x-axis and y-axis data (these must be the same length). 
Using these, we will create a pre-formatted plot for the temperature outlook for however long the data goes on. 
This plot will be returned to the user as well as automatically saved to the hard drive.
We can easily use the numpy array created in the webscraping function 'london_weather' as the program's inputs.
